# FLOW — Interaction Flow

> Placeholder. Will hold the end-to-end interaction flow diagram once it is defined —
> expected shape: hotkey → Screen Capture → Vision/Coordinate Detection → Jev →
> Tutor Engine → Visual Lesson Engine → Screen Overlay / Voice pipeline → Notes persistence.
>
> Screen Capture leg today: `ScreenCaptureService.CaptureAllMonitorsAsync` → one `MonitorCapture`
> per monitor (cursor's monitor first) → `MonitorCapture.Jpeg`, a downscaled B8G8R8A8 JPEG (≤1280 px,
> aspect preserved), plus `NonBlackPixelRatio` so Vision can reject a blank frame. One-shot per call;
> no running capture while idle.
>
> Vision leg today: one `MonitorCapture` + a question → `VisionService.LocateAsync` →
> `VisionResult` carrying source-local and screen-space (`PixelRect`) boxes plus a confidence verdict
> (`Confidence` from `RawConfidence` + cross-sample `Consistency`) — the exact signal shapes the future
> Jev confidence-gate will consume. Transport is behind `IVisionClient` (direct DeepSeek today,
> temporary pending the API key security proxy).
>
> Module names used here must match [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) verbatim.
